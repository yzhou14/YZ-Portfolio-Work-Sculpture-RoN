                <h3>Repairing of Nature</h3>
            </div>
            <h4>2020, Plastic models, epoxy, paper, photographing, computer processing, 1920x1080，300dpi</h4>
            <p>Sculpture photography works.</p>
            <p>The whole work uses linear narration to describe that in the future we can see, human beings are back-eaten by nature due to excessive development and destruction of the environment, and most of them are swallowed by the sea. The nature returns to its original appearance, and a few surviving human beings sail to the unknown distance in the ark. I want to use this work to convey to the audience that the survival of human beings depends on nature. Now people endlessly seek from nature, and they will surely reap the consequences in the future. At the same time, this work also shows the self-healing of nature that I predict in the future.</p>
